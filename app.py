# NOTE: Futures markets are open for trading from Sunday 6 PM to
#  Friday 5 PM ET (excluding observed holidays),
#  with a 1-hour break each day from 5 PM â€“ 6 PM ET

# NOTE: Need to figure out the trading logic here with orders
#   Following Aurox guides, we should only be taking signals on the Weekly and maybe daily
#   We need to factor in the Futures closing after each month (April, May, June, etc.)
#   We should store each Weekly and Daily signal in the database to help track where we're at
#   While were in a Weekly Long or Short and the Futures closes for that month, we should
#   Re-open a Long or Short based on the signal. We only reverse once the opposing Weekly signal
#   comes into play. This is a long game.

# NOTE:
#   Perhaps one way we operate is if the Weekly is long, use the Daily Aurox signals for
#   longs only and close out after expiration or a certain percentage to minimize risk (10%?).
#   Then keep opening Daily longs per each indicator while under the Weekly long. perhaps we wait
#   for a duration or percentage from the last signal, or a reverse Daily signal before placing a close order.

# NOTE: Should we do laddering with orders to caught spikes and other liquidations or quick reversals?

# NOTE: Since this whole bot is based on the Aurox Indicator (Ax) signal. We really need to wait
#   and be patient with it. Again, weekly sigals are far and in few throughout the year.
#   Scenario One:
#       The week of Sep 25h, 2023 we see a green long signal. It wasn't until Sep 28th, 2023 using Coinbase
#       BTC/USD chart in Aurox that we see the first Daily signal. Now, technically we could start opening
#       a long trade after the Weekly comes in and that might be ok, but we're aiming for safety, especially
#       dealing with future contracts. BTC had been going sideways even prior to that weekly, so you really
#       need to watch the charts, turn off the trading (but keep the bot running to track the signals)
#       if you feel it's too risky or not worth trading.
#       Around the beginning of Oct (5th, 7th and 9th) we see more Daily signals (Short, Long, Short),
#       then a dip in the market until another green long on Oct 15th, then a nice surge in the market upwards.
#       Technically speaking, if we had waited to place the first trade around the first Daily (into Oct),
#       then we'd be in a new contract month and riding out the dip, it would have been a great place
#       to be. We could then close out at that Daily short signal right before end the of Oct on the 27th.
#       That would have been roughly 25% on that trade (or multiple trades if you DCA on the dip).
#       Note: We need to track and trade within the monthly contracts to avoid forceful closing them on Coinbase Futures.
#   Scenario Two:
