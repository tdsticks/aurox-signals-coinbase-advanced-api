# Aurox Account and Tokens
https://docs.getaurox.com/product-docs
1. Create a new Aurox account
2. Purchase at least 3 URUS tokens on the ETH or BNB network (store in a wallet that the Aurox 
   terminal can connect to)
3. Get familiar and setup their trading terminal (not lite, but grid)
4. Add the Coinbase BTC/USD chart as a guide for the Ax signal. Yes, I know it's not exact, but we will
   use it 
   as a guide line for our signals.
5. Create alerts for Long and Shorts using the Ax signal for Daily and Weekly timeframes. You should 
   have four alerts.
   1. Add your local (ngrok public URL) for testing on your local system,
   2. Add an email if you'd like to get the alerts via email
6. Also setup long and short alerts on the 1 minute timeframe. This is solely for testing
   locally and not to actually trade with as that would be ludicrous!
> NOTE: Aurox alerts are a bit finicky as once they run one time you can't edit them, 
> so you'll need to copy the name, duplicate it and add a value to the name, like "v2"
